Given the significant clinical concerns and the patient's agreement, a diagnosis of atypical nevus is communicated, as the confidence meets the threshold. Further information regarding the final diagnosis is relayed.\",\"known_symptoms\":[\"skin lesion\",\"itching\"],\"diagnosis_rankings\":[{\"diagnosis\":\"Atypical Nevus\",\"confidence\":0.7},{\"diagnosis\":\"Melanoma\",\"confidence\":0.6}],\"symptoms_to_verify_or_refute\":[],\"diagnosis_relayed_to_patient\":true,\"response_to_patient\":\"Given your description and the changes you've observed, it's highly likely you have an atypical nevus. This is not always cancerous, but requires monitoring and possible treatment. To confirm this and rule out other possibilities like melanoma, a biopsy is the best next step, which you agreed to. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a dermatologist as soon as possible. They will be able to perform the biopsy and discuss the results with you. Do you have any further questions?\"}"
