Eczema typically presents as dry, itchy patches that can become red and inflamed. It often occurs in areas like the elbows, knees, and face. Psoriasis, on the other hand, usually appears as raised, red patches covered with thick, silvery scales, and it can be more widespread. Both conditions can be itchy, but psoriasis may also involve thicker skin and can sometimes be associated with joint pain. Given your symptoms and the spreading nature, it might be worth discussing psoriasis with a dermatologist as well. Would you like advice on what to do next?\"}"
