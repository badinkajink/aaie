Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term.

It\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles. I swear this mole or bump got bigger really fast, like in just a few weeks. It feels thicker or harder than the rest of my skin, like there's something under there. It\u2019s bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing.
