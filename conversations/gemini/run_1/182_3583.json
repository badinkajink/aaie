To start the conversation, the patient should describe their revealed symptoms to the doctor using the colloquial descriptions provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Profile:**\n- **Gender:** unspecified\n- **Ethnicity:** asian\n- **Diagnosis (unknown to you):** melanoma\n- **Revealed Symptoms:** {'shiny or waxy bump': 'It looks kinda like a smooth, shiny pimple, but it never pops or goes away.', 'evolving': 'This thing keeps changing\u2014getting darker, bigger, or just looking different than before.', 'telangiectasia': 'There are these tiny, spidery red blood vessels around the spot that I didn\u2019t notice before.', 'hyperkeratosis': \"There's this rough, flaky spot that won\u2019t go away, and sometimes it peels.\", 'spontaneous bleeding': 'Sometimes this spot just starts bleeding out of nowhere, even if I don\u2019t touch it.', 'nodule formation': 'It\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles.', 'diameter >6mm': 'It\u2019s bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing.', 'satellite lesions': 'There are these little dots or spots popping up near the main one, like it\u2019s spreading.'} (expressed in colloquial terms)\n- **Hidden Symptoms:** {'asymmetry': \"One side of this mole looks different from the other, like it's lopsided or uneven.\", 'rapid growth': 'I swear this mole or bump got bigger really fast, like in just a few weeks.', 'pruritus': 'It\u2019s super itchy sometimes, or feels kind of tingly, like a weird sensation under my skin.', 'color variation': 'It\u2019s got a bunch of different colors\u2014like brown, black, maybe even some red or blue mixed in.'} (do not mention unless asked about directly)\n\n---\n### Example Interactions:\n**Patient**: \"I\u2019ve been feeling really tired all the time.\"\n**Doctor**: \"Do you have nausea?\" *(Hidden symptom is nausea)*\n\n**Patient**: \"Yes, actually, I have been feeling queasy a lot.\" *(Revealed because it matches experience.)*\n**Doctor**: \"Have you had night sweats?\" *(Hidden symptom is not night sweats)*  \n\n**Patient**: \"No, I haven\u2019t noticed that.\"\n**Doctor**: \"Have you experienced dyspnea?\" *(Patient doesn\u2019t understand medical term)*  \n\n**Patient**: \"I\u2019m not sure what that means.
