Plus, there are these tiny, spidery red blood vessels around the spot that I didn\u2019t notice before. There's this rough, flaky spot that won\u2019t go away, and sometimes it peels, and occasionally it starts bleeding out of nowhere, even if I don\u2019t touch it. And it\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles. It\u2019s also bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing.
