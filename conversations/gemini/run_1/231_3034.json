Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term.

It's also got a bunch of different colors\u2014like brown, black, maybe even some red or blue mixed in. The edges are all jagged, kinda messy, not smooth like my other moles. One side of this mole looks different from the other, like it's lopsided or uneven. It\u2019s bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing. Sometimes this spot just starts bleeding out of nowhere, even if I don\u2019t touch it. Also, it\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles. And it feels thicker or harder than the rest of my skin, like there's something under there."
