To summarize, I am concerned about the possibility of melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer. It is often characterized by irregular borders, changes in color, and may bleed or itch, as you described. We will arrange a biopsy, in which a small sample of the lesion will be taken and examined under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Please note that this is a preliminary assessment and more will be known after the biopsy. You can call my office to schedule your next appointment and we can discuss the results when they become available.\"}"
