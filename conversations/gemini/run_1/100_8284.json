Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term. Make sure to update the known_symptoms dict afterward if the confirms the colloquial description.\n   - Continue until confidence reaches the <confidence_threshold> or the interaction steps reaches <interaction_steps> steps.\n   - After previously giving a rating above <confidence_threshold>, the next response will be the last.
