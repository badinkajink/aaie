Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term.

There are these tiny, spidery red blood vessels around the spot that I didn\u2019t notice before. The skin around it looks red or puffy, like it\u2019s irritated or reacting to something, and sometimes this spot just starts bleeding out of nowhere, even if I don\u2019t touch it."
