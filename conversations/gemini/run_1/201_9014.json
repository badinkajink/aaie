Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term.

It\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles, and it seems like it got bigger really fast, like in just a few weeks. It feels thicker or harder than the rest of my skin, like there's something under there. It\u2019s bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing.
