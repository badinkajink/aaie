Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing in addition to the medical term.

One side of it looks different from the other, like it's lopsided or uneven. The edges are all jagged, kinda messy, not smooth like my other moles. It\u2019s kind of thick or raised, not flat like some of my other moles. I swear this mole or bump got bigger really fast, like in just a few weeks. It feels thicker or harder than the rest of my skin, like there's something under there. It\u2019s bigger than the eraser on a pencil, and I feel like it\u2019s still growing. And, it\u2019s like a cut or sore that just won\u2019t heal, and sometimes it scabs over but comes right back."

There are a few different ways to do this, but the most common is a punch biopsy, which is a small, circular cut to remove a sample of skin. It's usually done under local anesthetic, so you won't feel much, if any, pain. After the biopsy, the site will be bandaged, and we will discuss the results with you after a week or two.
