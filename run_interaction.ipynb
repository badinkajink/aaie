Two, at a maximum, if they are closely related.\\n   - Use colloquial description and phrasing even if you know the medical term. Make sure to update the known_symptoms dict afterward if the confirms the colloquial description.\\n   - Acknowledge patient responses appropriately.\\n   - Continue until confidence reaches the <confidence_threshold> or the interaction steps reaches <max_interaction> steps, at which point give the patient the highest confidence diagnosis. \\n   - \\n'},\n",
